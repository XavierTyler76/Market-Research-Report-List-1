<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stud Welding Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capacitor Discharge (CD) Stud Welding</li><li>Arc Stud Welding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stud welding machines are categorized mainly into two types: Capacitor Discharge (CD) Stud Welding and Arc Stud Welding. CD stud welding utilizes stored electrical charge to rapidly drive the stud into the workpiece, allowing for precise, shallow penetration and minimal heat distortion, making it ideal for thin materials. In contrast, Arc stud welding employs a continuous electrical arc to fuse the stud to the metal, providing a stronger bond suitable for thicker materials and heavier applications. Both methods serve distinct manufacturing needs.</p></p>
