<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ship Exhaust Gas Cleaning System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Closed Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Hybrid Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ship Exhaust Gas Cleaning System market features three main types: Open Loop Scrubbers, Closed Loop Scrubbers, and Hybrid Scrubbers. Open Loop Scrubbers use seawater to wash exhaust gases, discharging treated water back into the ocean without additional chemicals. Closed Loop Scrubbers, on the other hand, reuse water and rely on chemicals to neutralize pollutants, discharging only treated water. Hybrid Scrubbers can operate in both modes, offering flexibility for compliance in varying environmental conditions and regulations.</p></p>
