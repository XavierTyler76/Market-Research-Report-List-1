<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Cylinders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Acting Cylinders</li><li>Double-Acting Cylinders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The air cylinders market features two primary types: single-acting and double-acting cylinders. Single-acting cylinders use air pressure to move the piston in one direction, relying on a spring or external force for the return. They are typically used in applications requiring less force. In contrast, double-acting cylinders utilize air pressure for both extending and retracting the piston, providing greater efficiency and control. This makes them suitable for heavier loads and more complex operations in various industrial sectors.</p></p>
