<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground Method</li><li>Reservoir Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery (MEOR) involves two primary methods: Ground Method and Reservoir Method. The Ground Method utilizes microbes in surface applications to enhance oil recovery before it reaches the reservoir, effectively altering soil characteristics to improve extraction. In contrast, the Reservoir Method employs specialized microorganisms directly within the oil reservoir to optimize oil flow by reducing viscosity and altering surface tension. Both methods aim to improve oil recovery efficiency and increase production from aging oil fields while minimizing environmental impact.</p></p>
