<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flue Gas Coolers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tube Type</li><li>Fume Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flue gas coolers market comprises two main types: tube type and fume type. Tube type coolers feature a series of tubes that allow flue gas to pass through while transferring heat to a cooling medium, enhancing efficiency and reducing emissions. Fume type coolers use a more integrated design to manage the flue gas effectively by cooling it directly through contact with a cooling medium. Both types are essential for optimizing energy recovery and supporting environmental regulations in various industrial applications.</p></p>
