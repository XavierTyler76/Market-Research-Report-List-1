<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Alkalinity Blast-Furnace Slag</li><li>Acidic Blast-Furnace Slag</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag (GBS) can be categorized into two main types based on its alkalinity. Alkalinity Blast-Furnace Slag has higher pH levels, making it suitable for applications that require enhanced resistance to acids and improved strength characteristics in concrete. Acidic Blast-Furnace Slag, conversely, has lower pH levels and is often utilized in scenarios where less resistance to alkaline conditions is acceptable. Both types contribute to sustainable construction practices by recycling waste materials from iron production, enhancing concrete properties, and reducing carbon footprints.</p></p>
